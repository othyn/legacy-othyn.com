This repo is the codebase for my website: [othyn.com](https://othyn.com)

# TODO
- Other site pages (v0.0.9 was too hasty)
- Unit Tests
- Remove dist directory
- Implement as background / fade in after animation, using the 4 key colours: https://github.com/qrohlf/trianglify
- Tooltips on icon hover
